3d Printed Case for the [ChipStomp](https://github.com/Catmacey/ChipStomp)
=================================

This is a 3d printed case for my ChipStomp.

The design is created in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)

The case is split into three stacking parts, the top, middle and bottom.

The top contains the most detail including holes for buttons, potentiometers, the screen and leds. It also has substantial internal supporting ribs to provide more support around the holes in the top surface.
