3d Printed Case for the [ChipStomp](https://github.com/Catmacey/ChipStomp)
=================================

This is a 3d printed case for my ChipStomp.

The design is created in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) and is intended for printing using a nothing-special FDM printer with a 0.4mm nozzle.  Mine's a [ProFab Mini](http://profab3d.com/product/profab-mini-v3-3d-printer/) (an upgraded mono price mini)

The case is split into three stacking parts, the top, middle and bottom.

The case fits the SOB 100x80mm PCB and is held togethjer by screws from underneath.
The lower "foot" has a space for a standard 3 cell AA battery holder.

The top contains the most detail including holes for buttons, potentiometers, the screen and leds. It also has substantial internal supporting ribs to provide more support around the holes in the top surface.
